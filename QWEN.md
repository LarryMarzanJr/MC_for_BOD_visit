## Qwen Added Memories
- Today's date is Monday, October 6, 2025. I'm working on MC scripts for an SMBC Indonesia BOD meeting.
- MC scripts in English and Indonesian are complete with job titles preserved in English.
- Both MCs (Larry and Marlen) are included as per requirements.
- All documentation is complete and ready for the Town Hall event.
- Added 5 open transition scripts between individual questions during the Q&A session with Mr. Munandar to both English and Indonesian scripts, allowing smooth transitions without assuming knowledge of the next questioner or their question topic.
- Updated both English and Indonesian scripts to align with the personnel listed in the rundown.md file, including Jun Saito San (DEPUTY PRESIDENT DIRECTOR), Windayani (REGIONAL BUSINESS HEAD SME), Aida Belina Tenando (REGIONAL BUSINESS LEADER WMB & RETAIL REGIONAL HEAD), and Pujangga Pradana Putra (REGIONAL BUSINESS LEADER PENSION BUSINESS).
- Corrected Henoch Munandar's title from 'CEO' to 'President Director' as specified in the rundown.md file and updated all related references in both scripts.
- Removed references to Cindyani, Reyhan Pasidya, and Mustaqim Adamrah from both scripts to align with the personnel in the rundown.md file.
- Added the Area Leader & Manager personnel to both scripts as specified in the rundown.md file.
- Created a mixed Indonesian-English MC script (mc_mixed_id_en.md) where Larry and Marlen alternate between languages, with the exception of Jun Saito San's introduction which is done by Larry in English.
- On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, updated the mixed Indonesian-English MC script to ensure only Jun Saito San is introduced in English, while the rest of the key personnel introductions are in Indonesian.
- Updated the mixed script to replace 'kami memiliki' with 'hadir juga bersama kita saat ini' for a more natural Indonesian introduction flow.
- Updated the area leader and manager introduction to specifically mention 'Area Manado' for clarity.
- On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, removed the "Mr." title from Jun Saito San's introduction in all scripts to align with Japanese honorific usage, since "-san" already functions as a respectful honorific similar to "Mr." or "Ms." in English.
- On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, created additional pantun files for the Town Hall event: pantun_kocak.md (funny pantuns), pantun_acara_townhall.md (Town Hall-specific pantuns), pantun_acara_townhall_humor_positif.md (positive Town Hall pantuns), and pantun_3_acara_townhall.md (enhanced rhyme Town Hall pantuns).
- On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, revised pantun_3_acara_townhall.md to improve humor while keeping content non-offensive and maintaining better rhyme patterns.
- On Wednesday, October 8, 2025, added interactive pantun sections with references to the pantun files in both mc_indonesia.md and mc_mixed_id_en.md at the opening welcome and after the introduction of key people.
